Great question! A **README** file is like the **user manual** or **first impression** of your project — especially on platforms like GitHub. It's usually a file named `README.md` written in **Markdown**, a simple formatting language.

Let’s break it down step-by-step:

---

## 🧾 What is a README file?

A **README** is a plain text or Markdown (`.md`) file that tells:

* 📦 What your project is
* 🚀 How to run or install it
* 💻 How to use it
* 👤 Who made it (optional)
* ⚙️ Any dependencies or contributions
